This is the Debian prepackaged version of BSD csh(1), originally put
together by Dominik Kubla <dominik@debian.org>, and subsequently updated
by Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>, Edward Brocklesby <ejb@debian.org>,
Michael Stone <mstone@debian.org>, and Matej Vela <vela@debian.org>.

The original sources were retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS repository
(anoncvs@anoncvs.openbsd.org:/cvs).  The upstream tarball can be
recreated using `debian/rules get-orig-source'.

csh was written by William Joy et al. at the University of California at
Berkeley and is copyright (c) 1980-1993 by the Regents of the University
