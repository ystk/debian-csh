csh (20060413-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Since glibc is broken with respect to GLOB_NOMAGIC and backslashes
    (and its maintainers refuse to see the light), switch back to BSD's
    implementation of glob.  Closes: #220170.
  * Incidentally, this removes the need to reimplement glob_t.gl_matchc,
    fixing a bug that was causing `No match' errors when some patterns did
    match and some didn't.  Closes: #350869.
  * Prefix BSD libc sources (glob.c, strlcpy.c, vis.c) with an underscore
    to avoid a conflict with our own glob.c.
  * _glob.c (globtilde): Replace issetugid with calls to get{e,}{u,g}id.
  * Use add-shell and remove-shell.  Closes: #361544.
  * Switch to debhelper 5.
  * debian/copyright: Document `debian/rules get-orig-source'.
  * debian/doc-base: Rephrase abstract.
  * debian/rules: Set CVS_RSH to ssh.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.6.2.

csh (20050313-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Revert to a flat source tree, it does make things simpler.
  * exp.c (exp2): Rename to csh_exp2 to avoid conflict with gcc builtin
    (thanks to Andreas Jochens).  Closes: #258588.
  * glob.c (libglob): GLOB_NOMAGIC has been fixed in glibc 2.3 (#106097).
  * proc.c (dokill): glibc has an undocumented sys_sigabbrev array with
    signal names, so we no longer have to generate our own.
  * vis.c (isvisible): Comparison with UCHAR_MAX triggers `always true'
    warnings for unsigned char arguments; since this is already checked by
    isascii, remove it.  Closes: #268438.
  * vis.h: Remove OpenBSD-specific `bounded' attribute.
  * Switch to debhelper 4.
  * debian/doc-base: Add doc-base support.
  * debian/menu: Add menu file (thanks to Bill Allombert).  Closes: #187629.
  * debian/rules:
    - Re-enable -Werror on alpha now that #97603 is fixed.
    - Make sure groff uses traditional (non-ANSI) escape sequences.
    - Remove support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=debug.
    - Add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.6.1.

csh (20020413-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Removed the /usr/bin/csh compatibility symlink.  Since /usr/bin
    precedes /bin in the PATH, a configure script would use the former
    location instead of the one managed by alternatives, and things
    wouldn't work with tcsh (cf. #106547).  Obviously, this doesn't break
    anything that isn't already broken for tcsh.

csh (20011113-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version.
  * csh.c: On glibc (<< 2.2), call cookie_seek_function_t with an
    off_t instead of an off64_t *.  The package now builds on potato.
    Closes: #119344.
  * csh.c: Leave standard streams open for progprintf.
  * csh.c, proc.c: Substitute fpurge with the recently added __fpurge.
  * csh.h: On the Hurd, <sys/param.h> seems to define MAXPATHLEN to
    PATH_MAX without defining the latter; provide a default.
  * func.c (doprintf): progprintf uses stdout/stderr, so flush those
    rather than cshout/csherr.
  * pathnames.h (_PATH_LOGIN): login is in /bin, not /usr/bin.

csh (20010813-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version.
  * debian/rules: stdio.h causes a cpp warning on alpha; conditionally
    disable -Werror until #97603 is fixed.  Closes: #106285.
  * glob.c: GLOB_NOMAGIC produces false positives for patterns like
    `*/xxx'; work around it until #106097 is fixed.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.5.6.

csh (20010413-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version, re-ported from OpenBSD-current:
    * csh.c: Include <time.h> for time_t etc.  Closes: #90859.
    * csh.c (main, readf, writef, seekf, closef): funopen substituted
      with fopencookie.
    * csh.c (pintr1), proc.c (pprint): fpurge substituted with fflush.
      (Anything better?)
    * csh.h: Define MAXPATHLEN to 4096 if it isn't already defined (e.g.
      on the Hurd).  If X11 and Tcl can get away with it, so can we. ;-)
      Closes: #54993.
    * glob.c (libglob):
      * Don't set GLOB_QUOTE, it's already default.
      * Work around gl_matchc, this time correctly.  Closes: #88780.
    * misc.c (closem): Upstream fixed it to use `sysconf (_SC_OPEN_MAX)'
      rather than NOFILE.  Closes: #63650.
    * proc.c (dokill), proc.h, siglist.in: Use our own sys_signame
      array, constructed from siglist.in (taken from pdksh 5.2.14).
  * Package is orphaned (see #92493); maintainer set to Debian QA Group.
  * Converted to debhelper.  Closes: #91435.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.5.2:
    * Added build dependencies.  Closes: #90860.
    * debian/rules: Support the `debug' build option.
    * debian/copyright: Updated.
  * Changed priority to optional, catching up with the override file.
  * debian/lintian: Override the `binary-without-manpage: csh' Lintian
    error caused by the /usr/bin/csh -> /bin/csh symlink.
  * debian/rules: Added a `get-orig-source' target.
  * Removed pre-bo (<< 5.26-6) compatibility code.
