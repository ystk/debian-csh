Title: An Introduction to the C shell
Author: William Joy, Mark Seiden
Abstract: The C shell was originally written at UCB to overcome limitations
 in the Bourne shell.  Its flexibility and comfort (at that time) quickly
 made it the shell of choice until more advanced shells like ksh, bash, zsh
 or tcsh appeared.  Most of the latter incorporate features original to csh.
 .
 This is a step-by-step tutorial on interactive use of the C shell.  It is
 mainly of historical interest.
