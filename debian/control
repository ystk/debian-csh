Description: Shell with C-like syntax
 The C shell was originally written at UCB to overcome limitations in the
 Bourne shell.  Its flexibility and comfort (at that time) quickly made it
 the shell of choice until more advanced shells like ksh, bash, zsh or
 tcsh appeared.  Most of the latter incorporate features original to csh.
